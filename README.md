### Description

Let's use our front-end web development skills to create a "living" pet! We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with our pet.

#### Here is a [live example ](https://starter-code.madeline.vercel.app/) of what we are going to build


## Learning Objectives
Today's lesson will be focused on building out interactivity in the DOM. This will enable us to take the games we have been building and combine them with user interactivity. 

Along the way, we will be learning about some common UI and how to build them. These include:

- Building a [Modal](https://codepen.io/reidark/pen/FEueH)
- Building a [Carousel](https://codepen.io/arfeus/pen/BWOqZQ)
